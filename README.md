# Restricted Boltzmann Machine for Generating Ising Model states

This project uses restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to generate new Ising model spin states after being trained on data. Further details and the effect this has can be found in the report in root. Implemented using Python with SciKit-Learn. Training data generated using the program found at https://github.com/akoreman/Monte-Carlo-Ising-Model .
